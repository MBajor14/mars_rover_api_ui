# MARS ROVER API UI ## (DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS)
This is a simple react app (NOT built using create-react-app CLI) that uses NASA's mars 
rover API. The goal here is to get comfortable using API's and React. Maybe have some 
fun along the way. Cool.  

## Getting Started
First you need to get an API_KEY... I'll update this README with a link soon.
If you decide to just search (probably easy peasy), then once you have it, put the API 
key in the empty API_KEY string in App.js. ``npm install`` followed by an ``npm run``
should get you there... I hope.
